    "rationale": "Progressive Personalization is the best fit for HabitTrackerPro because it is a consumer app focused on helping individuals improve productivity and manage their screen time. The app collects user preferences related to task management and screen time goals, allowing it to adapt content and features based on user input. This approach aligns with the core user goal of setting up initial task and screen time goals, as it encourages users to customize their experience and receive personalized suggestions for habit improvement. The other patterns are less suitable; a Setup Wizard is more appropriate for B2B tools requiring complex configurations, while a Feature Discovery Tour is better suited for apps with complex interfaces. HabitTrackerPro's focus on user preferences and personalized goal setting makes Progressive Personalization the ideal onboarding pattern.",
