    "rationale": "The Setup Wizard is the best fit for CatHabitTracker because it allows users to complete a sequence of actions necessary for setting up their cat's profile and habit tracking. Given that the target audience consists of cat owners who may not be familiar with tracking their pets' habits, a structured onboarding process will guide them through the initial setup, ensuring they input essential information and understand how to use the app effectively. This pattern aligns with the onboarding goals of educating users, assisting in feature setup, and encouraging immediate activation by prompting them to log their cat's habits right from the first session. The other patterns are less suitable; a Feature Discovery Tour would not provide the necessary step-by-step guidance for initial setup, and Progressive Personalization is not ideal as the primary goal is to establish a habit tracking framework rather than adapting to user preferences over time.",
